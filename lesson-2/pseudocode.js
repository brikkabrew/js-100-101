// #1 - A function that returns the sum of two numbers

// Receive two numbers
// return the sum of number1 and number2
// call the function with two numbers

// #2 - A function that takes an array of strings and returns a string that is all of those strings put together

// Set an array of strings
// Create a function to receive that array
// Initialize a variable (superLongString) to hold the value of all the strings
// Read each element in the array and concatenate each element to the initialized var
// Return the result in the superLongString variable
// Call the function passing in an array

// #3 - A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.

// Given an array of numbers
// From index 0, filter the array returning only the index numbers that are even
// Return the new element

// #4 - A function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

// Given a string
// - Create a function with two parameters: string and character
// -- Initialize a variable to keep count of occurences
// -- Initialize an iterator variable to keep track of the string legnth
// -- While the iterator is less than the length of the string, compare the instances of characters in the string.
// -- If there is an instance of 'x' in the string, add it to the occurences variable
// -- Increment the iterator
// - Return the index of the final 'x' occurence
